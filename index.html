Hello! I am a 20-year-old college student currently attending the University of California Riverside. I am located in the San Fernando Valley, which wikipedia accurately describes as ‚Äúan urbanized valley in Los Angeles County‚Äù. I am a full-time student pursuing a bachelors degree in Econ. Administration.
My job experience, quite honestly, is very limited. I have worked a few odd jobs here and there, but nothing long-term or substantial‚Äîmostly jobs were I was paid cash, favors of sorts. The closest I‚Äôve come to carrying the label ‚Äúemployee‚Äù was occasionally, when the help was needed, working for my sister‚Äôs cleaning company, Ollie‚Äôs Scrub n Clean. As the job title describes, I cleaned or oversaw other‚Äôs work (or both). The cleaning jobs ranged from sprucing up staged houses, to tidying up Airbnbs, or simply just cleaning people‚Äôs homes. It is not easy work‚Äî it is taxing on the body, requires some level of technique, and surprisingly requires a fair amount diligence (if you want to do the work well). One might ask what one could take away from such seemingly mindless work, well I‚Äôll tell you‚Äîtime management. Not only do you have to work relatively quickly, but you have to make sure to dedicate an appropriate amount of time to each individual task. It can be tricky, and admittedly early on I often found myself running low on time and sloppily rushing though work, but through learning to manage my time appropriately‚Äîlearning the best method to clean or do certain tasks, choosing the right products, arranging tasks in a particular order, etc.‚ÄîI was able to learn to manage my time expertly. There is much to learn from even ‚Äúmenial‚Äù jobs. 
In high school, initially to my dismay, I was roped into joining the cabinet of a club, Latinos Unidos. This isn‚Äôt quite a job, in the traditional sense, but a meaningful experience nonetheless. I held a high position and was thus thrusted into a leadership role that I was wholly not prepared to hold. It was a bit daunting, as I am shy and not very assertive, but I grew into the role well. Eventually, I was managing meetings, planning fundraisers, and aiding in making decisions on where to allocate the club‚Äôs fundraiser earnings. Might I add that the club‚Äôs fundraisers were extremely successful. Those successful fundraisers provided the funds to plan field trips and organize other events, even arrange collaborative efforts with sister clubs. It was a spur of the moment commitment that resulted in a whole lot of growth for my personal development. The position taught me to work with others more effectively, how to take the helm when necessary, and allowed me to further develop my decision making skills. There are more to the sorts of positions than meets the eye.
